ABC Insurance, a global health insurance company, seeks to optimize its insurance policy
premium pricing based on the health status of applicants. Understanding an applicant's health
condition is crucial for two key decisions:
- Determining eligibility for health insurance coverage.
- Deciding on premium rates, particularly if the applicant's health indicates higher risks.

Here the objective is to Develop a predictive model that utilizes health data to classify individuals as
'healthy' or 'unhealthy'. This classification will assist in making informed decisions about
insurance policy premium pricing.
